        <p>Greetings everybody! I am Sam Leung (lcn).</p>
        <p>I have graduated Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) since 2019. Now I am a freelance programmer trying to create as many real-life applications as I can in order to train myself and post challenges on myself. I have created a number of applications such as </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/lcnssamlcn/jfx_stopwatch"  target="_blank">Stopwatch program</a> (desktop application for Mac OS X and Windows)</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/lcnssamlcn/javaee_file_transfer" target="_blank">Secure file transfer system</a> (web application)</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/lcnssamlcn/simple_calc" target="_blank">Scientific Calculator</a> (mobile application)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I always try to finish my projects as fast as I can in order to prepare myself in job realm. Time is the essence for everyone including clients.</p>
        <p>I can work independently. Even when I encounter any obstacles, I will try my best to solve them by finding solutions in awesome websites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
        <p>Please check my projects published on my <a href="https://github.com/lcnssamlcn" target="_blank">Github</a> page.</p>
